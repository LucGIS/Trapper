These tutorial will cover some of the actions you can perform in Trapper. Trapper allows different features depending on your role and participation in media classification projects. This tutorial page will be roughly divided according to these differences

Roles introduction

Roles in Trapper are hierarchically ordered.
The following roles exist within the Trapper:

* :ref:`role.anonymous`
* :ref:`role.crowdsourcing`
* :ref:`role.expert`
* :ref:`role.staff`

The least privileged user is the ``Anonymous`` user, each successive role introduces more permissions:

.. note::

    The hierarchy of *permissions* or *privileges* is as follows:

    ``Staff`` > ``Expert`` > ``Crowd-Sourcing`` > ``Anonymous``

    Each role on the **right** of any other role has **less** privileges.
    If your role in the Trapper is ``Expert``, tutorials on roles to your *right* will also be relevant you.
